            <p>3. <strong>Summary</strong><br>
                This year I got a desire to study and develop in the field of web development and not only. I went to courses and studied several disciplines at once. It is difficult, because I combine work, several homework at once. But I know, itâ€™s possible for me because I'm really interested in my feature work.
